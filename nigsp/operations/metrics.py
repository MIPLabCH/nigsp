    """
    Compute the Structural Decoupling Index (SDI).

    i.e. the ratio between the norms of the "high" and the norm of the "low"
    "graph-filtered" timeseries.

    If the given dictionary does not contain the keywords "high" and "low",
    the SDI is computed as the ratio between the norm of the second and
    the norm of the first dictionary entry.
    "keys" can be used to indicate the order of the two keys, or to select two
    elements of a bigger dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ts_split : dict or numpy.ndarray
        A dictionary containing two entries. If the two entries are "low" and
        "high", then SDI will be computed as the norm of the high vs the norm
        of the low, otherwise as the ratio between the second (second key in
        sorted keys) and the first.
    mean : bool, optional
        If True, compute mean over the last axis (e.g. between subjects)
    keys : None or list of str, optional
        Can be used to select two entries from a bigger dictionary
        and/or to specify the order in which the keys should be read (e.g.
        forcing a different order from the sorted keys).
