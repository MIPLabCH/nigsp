    Two methods are implemented, 'Bernoulli' and 'frequentist'.

    * 'frequentist' is a group or single subject test. It tests that the
      empirical data are in the highest (or lowest) percentile (where the
      percentile is defined by p/2).
    * 'Bernoulli' is a group test. It tests that the number of subjects for
      which the empirical data is higher (or lower) than a set of surrogates
      (frequentist approach) is at the tail of a binomial cumulative
      distribution (where 'tail' is defined by p).

    Note that p is expressed as two-tails test for the frequentist approach and
    a one-tail test for the Bernoulli approach.

    Both surr and data are expected to have first dimensions: observations [x subjects].

    Parameters
    ----------
    surr : numpy.ndarray
        The surrogate matrix, where all surrogates are aligned along the last axis.
        May have the empirical data matrix last along the last axis.
        Expected to have shape: observations, [subjects,] surrogates.
    data : numpy.ndarray or None, optional
        The empirical data matrix. If given, it's appended at the end of the
        surrogate matrix.
        Expected to have shape: observations[, subjects].
    method : 'Bernoulli' or 'frequentist', optional
        The method to adopt for testing, either based on a Bernoulli process
        or a frequentist observation (see above).
    p : float, optional
        The probability threshold to adopt for the frequentist approach part.
        Note that this is a two-tails test.
    p_bernoulli : float or None, optional
        The probability threshold to adopt for Bernoulli's test.
        If left as None, the specified p value will be used instead,
        and p will be set to 0.1.
        Note that this is a one-tail test.
    return_masked : bool, optional
        If True, returns the masked data. If False, returns a mask that holds
        True where the good data are (inverse of numpy mask). Mask has the same
        shape as data.
    mean : bool, optional
        If True, returns the average of the masked data along the last axis.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        A numpy.ndarray shaped observations[, subjects]. If return_masked is True,
        returns the masked version of `data`, otherwise returns the mask.
        If mean is True, returns the average along the subject axis.

    Raises
    ------
